This repostory is used for Unsupervised domain adaptation for instance segmentation using [SOLO](https://github.com/WXinlong/SOLO) which is based on [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04488) and [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10152) research works. We highly apprecitae autyhors for their work. For the installation, follow the procedure provided in the [original imlamentation](https://github.com/WXinlong/SOLO/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md).
