This repostory is used for [**Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Instance Segmentation: Extracting Dwellings in Temporary Settlements Across Various Geographical Settings**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10363437). The repository uses [SOLO](https://github.com/WXinlong/SOLO) as a base model which is based on [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04488) and [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10152) research works. We highly apprecitae authors for their work and opensource resurce. For the installation, follow the procedure provided in the [original imlamentation](https://github.com/WXinlong/SOLO/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md).
